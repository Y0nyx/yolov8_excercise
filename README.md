# yolov8_excercise

## Description
The goal of this excercise is to be able to create a deep learning model from nothing using the ultralytics librairie and this dataset :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/dog-and-cat-detection

here a example of a detection done using a yolov8 model train on this dataset :

## Requirements

to be able to do this simple yolov8 excercice, you must follow the step to well begin with ultralytics link here : https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

you must first downlaod the ultralytics librairie using (you can also add it via yout interpreter setup using pycharm):
```
pip install ultralytics
```

the requirement.txt file must be download like this :
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### hint

here some hint to help you with this excercice :
- The dataset may not be formated well
- you only have one big dataset
- the choice of parameter is really important
